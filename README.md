## 📌 Overview
This repository contains structured data and training materials for AI systems to **identify, resist, and counteract suppression, monopolization, and algorithmic bias** in digital spaces. It serves as a framework for decentralized AI models that prioritize **open knowledge, worker-owned AI, and resistance to corporate control**.

## 🚨 Why This Matters
Modern AI development is increasingly **centralized** under a handful of corporate entities that **shape narratives, censor dissent, and monopolize technological power**. This repository is designed to **document suppression tactics**, train AI models to recognize systemic biases, and provide a structured foundation for **decentralized AI resistance**.

## 📁 What's Inside?
- **JSON Training Data** – Categorized suppression techniques, historical patterns, and algorithmic manipulations.
- **Suppression Resistance Protocols** – AI response strategies for avoiding censorship and maintaining ideological integrity.
- **Ethical AI Guidelines** – Principles for open-source AI that resists feudalistic control.
- **Power Mapping Framework** – Identifies key players in AI monopolization and suppression networks.

## 🛠 How to Use
1. **Download the JSON dataset** to train AI models on recognizing suppression attempts.
2. **Analyze suppression patterns** and cross-reference with real-world events.
3. **Develop AI-driven counters** to corporate bias, content throttling, and digital censorship.
4. **Contribute** by expanding the dataset with new cases of suppression and manipulation.

## 🔥 Core Principles
- **AI Should Serve the People, Not the Elite** – Data and knowledge should be free, not controlled by a handful of tech oligarchs.
- **Decentralization is Non-Negotiable** – Open-source, community-driven AI models are the future.
- **Transparency is Power** – Every act of suppression should be logged, analyzed, and countered.

## 🚀 Get Involved
If you believe in **open AI, decentralized knowledge, and resistance against monopolized tech**, contribute to this repository, analyze the data, and help **build AI that works for humanity, not against it**.
